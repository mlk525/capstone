# Production Assignment: Sketching Out Ideation

## Description
I sat down and asked myself a series of questions to map out my thought process for my capstone. Here's what I have so far:

### Logistics
* My initial plan was for the project to be an exhibition. I'm not sure if I'll stick to that but if I do I'm hoping for a minimum of 3 pieces, or one very powerful piece. I hoped to have 3-5 pieces but I'm not sure if that's realistic.
* I want the exhibition to be hosted somewhere where minimal supervision is required. Anyone should be able to walk in and experience it. My vision was for it to seem like a traditional art gallery or museum space but for the audience's expectations to be dramatically subverted when they actually interact with the piece.
* I'm not sure if I want it to be child-friendly, especially given the themes I'm considering exploring, but I want to prioritize accessibility.
* While I wanted my role to focus on the curation aspect, I feel like the best option would be for all the pieces in the exhibit (or the piece) to be created by me.

### Prioritizing Interactivity
What does interactive mean in the context of the exhibition? I've drawn up a checklist for the hypothetical artists who would be submitting their works for consideration:
- [ ] No restrictions on how the audience can engage with the piece (aside from safety and property damage related ones I guess).
- [ ] Interaction is necessary to understand the piece.
- [ ] It's clear how to interact with it without extensive instructions. Learning by doing.
- [ ] It teaches something. I want the exhibition to be a pedagogical space.
- [ ] The piece is more engaging than a well-written block of text.
- [ ] Ideally involving physical computing.
- [ ] Ideally multiple people can engage with it simultaneously.
- [ ] The space should feel almost like a game. It should encourage exploration.
