# Production Assignment: Sketching Out Ideation

## Description
I sat down and asked myself a series of questions to map out my thought process for my capstone. Here's what I have so far:

### Logistics
* My initial plan was for the project to be an exhibition. I'm not sure if I'll stick to that but if I do I'm hoping for a minimum of 3 pieces, or one very powerful piece. I hoped to have 3-5 pieces but I'm not sure if that's realistic.
* I want the exhibition to be hosted somewhere where minimal supervision is required. Anyone should be able to walk in and experience it. My vision was for it to seem like a traditional art gallery or museum space but for the audience's expectations to be dramatically subverted when they actually interact with the piece.
* I'm not sure if I want it to be child-friendly, especially given the themes I'm considering exploring, but I want to prioritize accessibility.
* While I wanted my role to focus on the curation aspect, I feel like the best option would be for all the pieces in the exhibit (or the piece) to be created by me.

### Prioritizing Interactivity
What does interactive mean in the context of the exhibition? I've drawn up a checklist for the hypothetical artists who would be submitting their works for consideration:
- [ ] No restrictions on how the audience can engage with the piece (aside from safety and property damage related ones I guess).
- [ ] Interaction is necessary to understand the piece.
- [ ] It's clear how to interact with it without extensive instructions. Learning by doing.
- [ ] It teaches something. I want the exhibition to be a pedagogical space.
- [ ] The piece is more engaging than a well-written block of text.
- [ ] Ideally involving physical computing.
- [ ] Ideally multiple people can engage with it simultaneously.
- [ ] The space should feel almost like a game. It should encourage exploration.

### What are the Themes?
* Reclaiming/recontextualizing heritage
* Addressing misrepresentation
* Telling stories that don't get told
* Breaking down hierarchies: questioning who gets to tell stories, who was the authority to make the "big" narrative decisions.
* Anticolonialism, immigrant culture and oppression, empowering marginalized voices, active and informed consent in matters of culture and heritage.
* And of course, interactivity.

### Ideas for pieces
* A gallery of colonialist exhibits, the kind you see at most major museums and galleries, with augmented reality capacity that displays a role-reversed colonial exhibit.
* A gallery of role-reversed colonial exhibits.
* A virtual record of a marginalized voice: database of answers to potential questions from the audience that they can interact with.
* Making a traditional musical instrument from scratch that the audience can then play.
* An expanded (and more mandala-like) version of my transient crochet piece.
* An arcade-style game that explores the struggles of living as an immigrant in the UAE. Focus on labor abuses throughout the public and private sector, as well as attitudes of discrimination and erasure.
* A physical installation in the style of a Rube Goldberg machine that demonstrated the snowball effect of imperialism and colonialism on the present.
* An immersive installation that challenges how players “inhabit” bodies through first-person narratives.
