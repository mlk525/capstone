# Final Project Documentation
I'm excited to share the final version of Look Closer: Reclaiming Colonized Pasts, my interactive art installation project, which I presented at the IM Capstone exhibition.

Since my [last update](https://github.com/mlk525/capstone/blob/main/Update_Apr4.md), I incorporated some significant changes and additions. One of the biggest updates was incorporating artworks from three Tahitian artists into the project. I incorporated eight pieces in total into the installation. This was an important step in making sure my message of ensuring representation and preventing erasure, appropriation, or commodification came through. The artists, [HTJ](https://www.instagram.com/htjdesigns/), [Tahiri Sommer](https://www.instagram.com/tahiri_sommer/), and [Evrard Chaussoy](http://www.evrardchaussoy.com/), were all excited to contribute to the piece! I'm really glad I took this step, and I believe their contributions took my project to the next level.

In addition, I modified the layers of interaction so that Teha'amana disappears from the frame quickly as you approach her, to be replaced by the text I wrote (which changes as you step back and forth). Going even closer results in the question "What does it mean to decolonize Tahiti?" appearing briefly, after which each artwork from the Tahitian artists take turns appearing.

I faced some challenges mounting the monitor onto the wall, but ultimately ended up using a TV I borrowed from the film equipment center. I used gaffer tape to attach the frame onto the TV and vertically mounted the TV onto the wall of the Project Space. This allowed me to create the immersive experience I was aiming for, and the end result was quite convincing.

To really mimic the museum environment, I decided to add an audio tour element. I wrote and recorded a [script](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1psbUccZAMQccUvb2TxCv3yKFmKoST2b65F4_mL7d5v8/edit) that provided context for the piece while being critical of audio tours themselves. Viewers could access this audio tour via a QR code on the wall.

I set the Mac Mini that the project runs on to restart once a day, and there haven't been any issues. While the sketch slows down the longer it's active, it's not too noticeable since the Mac restarts just before the Project Space opens.

The project was very well received, with people asking thought-provoking questions about decolonizing art and culture. I'm thrilled with the progress I've made on this project and I'm excited to continue exploring these themes in my future work.
