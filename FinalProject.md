# Final Project Documentation
I'm excited to share with you the final version of my interactive art installation project, which I presented at the final exhibition. Since my last update, I've incorporated some significant changes and additions that I believe have taken the project to a new level.

One of the biggest updates was incorporating artworks from three Tahitian artists into the project. I received eight pieces in total, which I incorporated into the installation. This was important to me because I wanted to honor and celebrate the culture and art of Tahiti and French Polynesia and avoid any appropriation or commodification.

In addition, I modified the layers of interaction so that Teha'amana disappears from the frame quickly as you approach it, to be replaced by the text I wrote. Going even closer results in the question "What does it mean to decolonize Tahiti?" appearing briefly, after which each artwork from the Tahitian artists appears. This was meant to provoke thought-provoking ideas about the colonial and male gaze and the impact on art and culture.

I faced some challenges mounting the monitor onto the wall, but ultimately ended up using a TV I borrowed from the film equipment center. I used gaffer tape to attach the frame onto the TV and vertically mounted the TV onto the wall of the Project Space. This allowed me to create the immersive experience I was aiming for.

To really mimic the museum environment, I decided to add an audio tour element. I wrote and recorded a script that provided context for the piece while being critical of audio tours themselves. Viewers could access this audio tour via a QR code on the wall.

I set the Mac Mini that the project runs on to restart once a day, and there haven't been any issues. While the sketch slows down the longer it's active, it's not too noticeable since the Mac restarts just before the Project Space opens.

The project was very well received, with people asking thought-provoking questions about decolonizing art and culture. I'm thrilled with the progress I've made on this project and I'm excited to continue exploring these themes in my future work.
