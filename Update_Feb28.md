# Progress Update (Feb 21)
After my mini breakthrough last week, I've been having a much better time working on my final project. After reaching out to Jon Bonner and Steven Doughty I'm feeling a lot more confident about producing the wooden frame for my final display. I contacted the equipment center to book the same kind of TV Steven booked for Coin-Op; I've booked a TV and will be picking it up later this week, which is a pretty big milestone for me. I look forward to testing my sketch on the big screen. I chose not to go with a 4K screen, but let's see if that was a good idea.

I'm currently in the process of designing a 3D model for the wooden frame surrounding the TV. This is a bit new to me, but I have some 3D modeling and manufacturing experience, so I'm optimistic that I can get it done.

With Aaron's help, I also spent some time this week smoothing out the p5js animation and made it streak like old television pictures. It's looking really cool and adds to the aesthetic that I'm going for. I still need to figure out how to make the parts move randomly though.

Mang suggested that integrating original artwork created by me would help make the work more impactful, so I've been devoting time to sketching ideas and just practicing sketching in general.
I was also able to do some user testing this week, which was really helpful. Professor Alia Yunis suggested that I choose a well-known painting as my starting point so my point would come across more powerfully, which is definitely something to consider as I move forward. I'm feeling really good about the direction of my project and am excited to keep pushing forward.
