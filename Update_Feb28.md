# Progress Update - User Testing (Feb 28)
It's been a busy week, but I feel like I've made some great progress.

First, I made some significant changes, including finding and modifying a cool p5js glitch effect and working it into my latest prototype. I decided to follow the advice of Prof. Yunis and made my latest prototype with the Mona Lisa. I edited the Mona Lisa into layers to allow for the eye-following effect and using stable diffusion, I created a skeletal version of the Mona Lisa to glitch into existence and freak out people who came too close. I also added text messages from the perspective of the painting, telling viewers to go away.

After making these changes, I scheduled user testing with another professor, but unfortunately, they had to cancel. So instead, I scheduled user testing with a bunch of my friends from different backgrounds. Here are some [short videos]() of them interacting with the piece.

I also asked them to fill out a form for feedback and spoke to them about the experience. Here the questions on the form:

* What was your initial impression of *Look Closer*?
* On a scale of 1-5, how much do you agree with the following statements:
  * I initially felt like I was looking at a picture of a regular painting.
  * At some point I thought something was wrong with the piece.
  * I felt watched by the painting.
  * I could tell my movement affected the piece.
  * I questioned my impact as a viewer on the piece.
  * The experience challenged my perspective on the traditional gallery or museum experience.
  * The installation made me think about observer-observed relationships in museum settings.
  * The installation made me think about colonialism and decolonization.
* (After providing the description) How did your experience compare to the description?
* If you were to change the painting, what would you change it to? Would you stick with a well known painting?
* If you were to change how your movement affected the piece, what would you change?
* What other changes would you make to the experience?

I got a lot of useful feedback from them, and I'm excited to make some more changes based on their suggestions. Here are some of the highlights:

    Some users wanted more interactivity beyond just eye-tracking.
    Some users found the "go away" messages funny, while others found them annoying.
    Some users suggested incorporating multiple paintings or historical figures into the project to make it more interesting.
    Some users suggested incorporating more text or historical context into the project.

Finally, I've been continuing to work on the 3D model for the frame, which I expect will be done by the weekend. I'm also hoping to incorporate multiple paintings into the project in time for the exhibition next week.
