# Progress Update - User Testing (Feb 28)
It's been a busy week, but I feel like I've made some great progress.

First, I made some significant changes, including finding and modifying a cool p5js glitch effect and working it into my latest prototype. I decided to follow the advice of Prof. Yunis and made my latest prototype with the Mona Lisa. I edited the Mona Lisa into layers to allow for the eye-following effect and using stable diffusion, I created a skeletal version of the Mona Lisa to glitch into existence and freak out people who came too close. I also added text messages from the perspective of the painting, telling viewers to go away. I also wanted the installation to switch between different paintings, but I wasn't able to get that done in time for user testing.

After making these changes, I scheduled user testing with another professor, but unfortunately, they had to cancel. So instead, I scheduled user testing with a bunch of my friends from different backgrounds. Here are some [short videos](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_2quWwiArDcM28HWAT7gpDf2jlCJwHnY/view?usp=sharing) of them interacting with the piece.

I also asked them to fill out a form for feedback and spoke to them about the experience. Here the questions on the form:

* What was your initial impression of *Look Closer*?
* On a scale of 1-5, how much do you agree with the following statements:
  * I initially felt like I was looking at a picture of a regular painting.
  * At some point I thought something was wrong with the piece.
  * I felt watched by the painting.
  * I could tell my movement affected the piece.
  * I questioned my impact as a viewer on the piece.
  * The experience challenged my perspective on the traditional gallery or museum experience.
  * The installation made me think about observer-observed relationships in museum settings.
  * The installation made me think about colonialism and decolonization.
* (After providing the description) How did your experience compare to the description?
* If you were to change the painting, what would you change it to? Would you stick with a well known painting?
* If you were to change how your movement affected the piece, what would you change?
* What other changes would you make to the experience?

I got a lot of useful feedback from them, and I'm excited to make some more changes based on their suggestions. Here are some of the highlights:
* Eye glitch can be improved to give a stronger sense of belonging to the painting (I did this between user tests)
* Use different objects, like a cherry, to momentarily replace parts of the paintings body
* Keep the perspective of the painting consistent throughout in the text messages
* Experiment with distorting the image using different painting styles
* Explore ways to detect when a person is looking at the painting directly
* Give different paintings their own personalities (for when I cycle between paintings)
* Use words or phrases from texts that embody the gaze I am trying to draw attention to
* Consider using ethnographic sketches and newsprints, or more well known Orientalist paintings. Basically images that already make the viewer uncomfortable by what they represent.
* Have the image respond to waving somehow.
* Consider having Mona Lisa leave the painting or suddenly become bigger to jumpscare the viewer.
* Consider exploring the use of audio.

Finally, I've been continuing to work on the 3D model for the frame, which I expect will be done by the weekend. I'm also hoping to incorporate the multiple paintings idea into the project in time for the exhibition next week.
