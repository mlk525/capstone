## Title: Look Closer: Reclaiming colonized pasts

## Short Description
Look Closer is an interactive art installation that challenges the objectifying colonial gaze through abstraction.

## Abstract
Look Closer is an interactive art installation that initially presents itself as an orthodox gallery experience. Upon "closer" observation, the seemingly static piece begins to transform, defying the colonial gaze and the categories and definitions that come with it. The interactivity of the piece frames abstraction as decolonization, while also challenging the objectifying hierarchies created in traditional museums and galleries. The installation uses computer vision to track the viewer's movements and dynamically change the piece in real time, creating a unique experience for each individual. The viewer's actions become an integral part of the artwork, forcing them to question their own perspectives and the impact of their actions on the piece. By refusing to be easy to look at, Look Closer invites the audience to reflect on the hierarchies and power dynamics established through the colonial gaze.
