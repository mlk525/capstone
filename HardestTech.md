# Blog Post: Hardest Technology

Since I've worked with robotics in the context of performance before, I'm fairly confident in my ability to work with arduinos, servo motors and basic sensors. Two of my exhibition pieces will be mini-robots dressed up to be "artifacts" that interact with users, and I didn't foresee any major challenges in bringing them to life (other than inevitably having to troubleshoot an hour before they go on display). On the other hand, I wanted my third exhibition piece to be an interactive painting/inscription/any kind of 2D media. I'm currently debating between Egyptian hieroglyphs sculpted in relief and tomb paintings depicting scenes of the afterlife. In either case, I would need to me able to manipulate the images to move and respond to the user.

I have never worked with any sort of visual tracking technology before, so I think the most challenging technology for me to use would be motion tracking for the purposes of the paintings "seeing" the users.
