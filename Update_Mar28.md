# Progress Update - User Testing (Mar 28)
I made some significant changes based on feedback from previous user testing, so let's get into those before I talk about the feedback and suggestions from the second round of user testing.

Firstly, I've decided to switch the painting to "Merahi metua no Tehamana" by Paul Gauguin. I believe that Gauguin's work embodies the colonial and male gaze, which is something that I want to explore in my project. By using his painting, I hope to provoke a conversation about the way in which colonialism and the male gaze have influenced art and how we can move forward from this. More importantly, this painting is one of many works presented without context that would reflect badly on the artist and on the colonial environments that enabled them. Merahi metua no Tehamana is a protrait of Gauguin's "native wife" Teha'amana, who Gauguin claimed was 13 years old at the time of their marriage. This is also one of the only paintings in which Teha'amana is fully clothed. I believe if I can find a way to relay these contexts, especially from the perspective of Teha'amana, they will be key to getting my ideas across to the audience.

In addition to this, I've added the wooden frame I planned to the monitor, to give the installation a more traditional and organic feel. I used frame building resources from the Mixed Media studio, and kept the color light to try and give it a colonial era feel.

Finally, I incorporated AI generated art that emulates traditional Tahitian styles of painting, using the original painting as a base. The intention behind this was to create a seamless transition between the painting and the AI generated art, using abstraction as a form of decolonization (an idea I find myself returning to often). By fading into abstracted versions of the painting as the viewer gets closer, Teha'amana resists being observed and objectified, as a metaphor for broader resistance to the objectification and forced categorization that came with colonialism.

During the second round of user testing, I got some really positive feedback about these changes. I used the same form as my [first round](https://github.com/mlk525/capstone/blob/main/Update_Feb28.md). 
People thought the wooden frame added a nice touch and made the installation feel more polished and professional. Many of my users also loved the AI generated art and felt like it added a new layer of depth to the experience, saying they were amazed at how seamlessly the painting transitioned into the AI generated art.

Of course, there were still some areas for improvement. Some people felt like the new fade effect could be even more dramatic, while others thought the eye-following effect was a little too subtle (although I think I'm going to keep both of those features that way). But overall, the response was really positive, and I'm excited to continue working on the project and refining it even further.

I really want to create a meaningful and thought-provoking experience for viewers, but a big part of that is making sure I think through all my decisions too. SO I guess my next step is figuring out how to deal with the ethics of using AI-generated images.
