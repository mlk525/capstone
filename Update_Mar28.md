# Progress Update - User Testing (Mar 28)
I made some significant changes based on feedback from previous user testing, so let's get into those before I talk about the feedback and suggestions from user testing.

Firstly, I've decided to switch the painting to "Merahi metua no Tehamana" by Paul Gauguin. I believe that Gauguin's work embodies the colonial and male gaze, which is something that I want to explore in my project. By using his painting, I hope to provoke a conversation about the way in which colonialism and the male gaze have influenced art and how we can move forward from this. More importantly, this painting is one of many works presented without context that would reflect badly on the artist and on the colonial environments that enabled them. Merahi metua no Tehamana is a protrait of Gauguin's "native wife" Teha'amana, who Gauguin claimed was 13 years old at the time of their marriage.

In addition to this, I've added a wooden frame around the monitor to give the installation a more traditional and organic feel. This was done to emphasize the connection between the colonial and male gaze and the way in which traditional Tahitian art has been appropriated and commodified by Western artists.

Finally, I've incorporated AI generated art that emulates traditional Tahitian styles of painting. The intention behind this was to create a seamless transition between the painting and the AI generated art, highlighting the contrast between the colonial and male gaze and the way in which traditional Tahitian art has been appreciated and respected by its people.

One of the biggest changes I made was to incorporate AI generated art that emulated traditional Tahitian styles of painting. I wanted to take the glitch effect even further and create a truly immersive experience that would transport viewers to a different time and place. By fading the painting into AI generated art, I was able to create a seamless transition that felt like the painting was coming to life in a whole new way.

During the second round of user testing, I got some really positive feedback about these changes. People thought the wooden frame added a nice touch and made the installation feel more polished and professional. They also loved the AI generated art and felt like it added a new layer of depth to the experience. Several people said they felt like they were transported to Tahiti and were amazed at how seamlessly the painting transitioned into the AI generated art.

Of course, there were still some areas for improvement. Some people felt like the glitch effect could be even more pronounced, while others thought the eye-following effect was a little too subtle. But overall, the response was really positive, and I'm excited to continue working on the project and refining it even further.

While the response to these changes during user testing was positive, I understand that there may still be room for improvement. I am committed to continuing to refine this project and create a meaningful and thought-provoking experience for viewers.
