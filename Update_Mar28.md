# Progress Update - User Testing (Mar 28)
It's been a busy week, but I feel like I've made some great progress.

First, I made some significant changes, including finding and modifying a cool p5js glitch effect and working it into my latest prototype. I decided to follow the advice of Prof. Yunis and made my latest prototype with the Mona Lisa. I edited the Mona Lisa into layers to allow for the eye-following effect and using stable diffusion, I created a skeletal version of the Mona Lisa to glitch into existence and freak out people who came too close. I also added text messages from the perspective of the painting, telling viewers to go away. I also wanted the installation to switch between different paintings, but I wasn't able to get that done in time for user testing.

After making these changes, I scheduled user testing with another professor, but unfortunately, they had to cancel. So instead, I scheduled user testing with a bunch of my friends from different backgrounds. Here are some [short videos](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_2quWwiArDcM28HWAT7gpDf2jlCJwHnY/view?usp=sharing) of them interacting with the piece.

I also asked them to fill out a form for feedback and spoke to them about the experience. Here the questions on the form:

I got a lot of useful feedback from them, and I'm excited to make some more changes based on their suggestions. Here are some of the highlights:
* Eye glitch can be improved to give a stronger sense of belonging to the painting (I did this between user tests)


Finally, I've been continuing to work on the 3D model for the frame, which I expect will be done by the weekend. I'm also hoping to incorporate the multiple paintings idea into the project in time for the exhibition next week.
