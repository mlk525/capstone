# Prototype 1

## Description
My first prototype is an exploration of the themes I set out to work with when I wrote my capstone proposal. I asked two questions in particular:
* What is a museum?
* What is conflicted heritage?

While my answers just opened up more questions, I'm quite satisfied in the direction they took me and I'm excited to explore these themes further.

## What is a museum?
Acknowledging the "textbook" definition of a museum ("a building or institution that cares for and displays a collection of artifacts and other objects of artistic, cultural, historical, or scientific importance"), I began by asking my friends how they would describe the concept of a museum. Two answers stood out to me: "a place that tells a story with objects" and "a place for aliens to get a crash course on human culture".

The ideal museum exhibition (to me) uses artifacts to tell a engaging story. Museums also served as an indicator of what kind of art we made and liked, the kind of history we chose to preserve, and the kind of science we highlight. I don't think most museums in their current form tell engaging stories very well, nor do I think they are a good place for aliens to learn about human culture (unless they're looking to learn who invaded, exploited, and won all the wars). Setting aside the issue of engagement for now, that brought me to the question of conflicting heritage.

## What is conflicted heritage?
My understanding of conflicted heritage was pretty broad: heritage over which all stakeholders did not have the control they deserved. I wanted to dive deeper into the topic so I decided to investigate what I considered to be an instance of heritage in conflict. I'm particularly interested in the treatment of immigrants in the Gulf, so I decided on looking into a project I had heard about from a professor which involved shipwrights from Kerala working to recreate a Bronze Age boat.

The project, called [Má II](https://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/research/faculty-labs-and-projects/ma-the-ancient-boat-lab.html), is a joint experimental archaeology initiative between the Abu Dhabi Department of Culture and Tourism, Zayed University, and the Dhakira Center for Heritage Studies at New York University Abu Dhabi. 

Reading about the Bronze Age vessels and their connection to Dilmun (modern-day Bahrain and Qatar), Magan (UAE and Oman) and Meluhha (Pakistan), led me to believe that the shipbuilding heritage of the region could easily be tracked into the modern day. Even in school, during government-mandated study of UAE history, we were taught that abra-building was an integral part of the country’s heritage. My overall impression was that there were still Emirati boatbuilders.

I was initially confused to learn that the team building the 18-meter boat was entirely from Kerala, chosen for their extensive knowledge of traditional shipbuilding techniques passed down through generations. I was even more confused to learn how there was a market in Kerala shipyards for traditionally constructed boats, for the sole purpose of display in GCC countries. Noora (a fellow student who conducted ethnographic research on traditional boatbuilding here and in Kerala) even told me about a project in a north Kerala shipyard that was intended for display at the Qatar World Cup this year. Despite the fact that they wouldn’t exist without the preservation of Malayali heritage, these boats are somehow linked to the Gulf first. Ironic; the exploitation of immigrant labor without proper recognition (or just compensation) is a much better representation of the Gulf anyway.

The project being a joint initiative between the Abu Dhabi Department of Culture and Tourism, Zayed University, and the Dhakira Center for Heritage Studies is also an indicator of the assumptions made from its inception: the project will explore UAE heritage. Besides the Malayali shipwrights, the project’s primary investigators (Robert Parthesius and Eric Staples), Jonathan Sharfman and the on-site supervisor are all specialists in the region in some way or another, but as far as I can tell none of the project leads actually hold citizenship to a Gulf country. I find it interesting that the investigation into what is ostensibly UAE heritage is being spearheaded by people who cannot call it a permanent home. The project leads also appear to come almost exclusively from the Global North. I’m not sure how to begin tackling that, but I do think it’s worth addressing. Of course I see the value in this reconstruction; it has the potential to allow us a stronger understanding of the role maritime technology played in the Bronze Age. But what are the project’s priorities? The UAE has engaged in many, many initiatives to strengthen its cultural identity; do we accept the risk of transnational heritage being compromised in pursuit of this goal? Do we accept the risk of local migrant heritage being sacrificed as well? This project brought to light many points of concern (and resentment) I have as a UAE resident.

But upon speaking to some of the shipwrights, I discovered that they didn't share the same opinions I did. Similar to my parents, what I saw as labor exploitation and erasure were seen by these workers as wholly unremarkable. Apparently the abuses suffered by migrants were par for the course, something you accepted when you came to the region. I found it extremely hard to believe that the quality of life for (especially lower and lower middle class) immigrants was in any way better now that they had come to the Gulf. With none of the rights of citizens, there was not even a possiblity of recourse for the abuses experienced. I didn't want to project my own understandings of conflicted heritage onto this perspective, but I do have a hard time believing there is nothing wrong with how immigrants and immigrant heritage is treated in the UAE. Something for me to think about I guess.

## Suggestions
* The 7 Whys Technique: Ask 'why?' 7 times, starting with the question I consider to be at the core of my project.
* Using an artifact to tell a story: Explore the story of the Má II as the subject of the capstone (instead of as secondary to the medium)
* Explore the use of an interactive documentary.
