# Prototype 1

## Description
My first prototype is an exploration of the themes I set out to explore when I wrote my capstone proposal. I asked two questions in particular:

## Suggestions
* The 7 Whys Technique: Ask 'why?' 7 times, starting with the question I consider to be at the core of my project.
* Using an artifact to tell a story: Explore the story of the MÃ¡ II as the subject of the capstone (instead of as secondary to the medium)
* Explore the use of an interactive documentary
