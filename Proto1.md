# Prototype 1

## Description
My first prototype is an exploration of the themes I set out to explore when I wrote my capstone proposal. I asked two questions in particular:
* What is a museum?
* What is conflicted heritage?

While my answers just opened up more questions, I'm quite satisfied in the direction they took me and I'm excited to explore these themes further.

## What is a museum?
Acknowledging the "textbook" definition of a museum ("a building or institution that cares for and displays a collection of artifacts and other objects of artistic, cultural, historical, or scientific importance"), I began by asking my friends how they would describe the concept of a museum. Two answers stood out to me: "a place that tells a story with objects" and "a place for aliens to get a crash course on human culture".

The ideal museum exhibition (to me) uses artifacts to tell a story 

what kind of art we made and liked, the kind of history we chose to preserve, the kind of science we highlight

## Suggestions
* The 7 Whys Technique: Ask 'why?' 7 times, starting with the question I consider to be at the core of my project.
* Using an artifact to tell a story: Explore the story of the MÃ¡ II as the subject of the capstone (instead of as secondary to the medium)
* Explore the use of an interactive documentary
