# Prototype 1

## Description
My first prototype is an exploration of the themes I set out to work with when I wrote my capstone proposal. I asked two questions in particular:
* What is a museum?
* What is conflicted heritage?

While my answers just opened up more questions, I'm quite satisfied in the direction they took me and I'm excited to explore these themes further.

## What is a museum?
Acknowledging the "textbook" definition of a museum ("a building or institution that cares for and displays a collection of artifacts and other objects of artistic, cultural, historical, or scientific importance"), I began by asking my friends how they would describe the concept of a museum. Two answers stood out to me: "a place that tells a story with objects" and "a place for aliens to get a crash course on human culture".

The ideal museum exhibition (to me) uses artifacts to tell a engaging story. Museums also served as an indicator of what kind of art we made and liked, the kind of history we chose to preserve, and the kind of science we highlight. I don't think most museums in their current form tell engaging stories very well, nor do I think they are a good place for aliens to learn about human culture (unless they're looking to learn who invaded, exploited, and won all the wars). Setting aside the issue of engagement for now, that brought me to the question of conflicting heritage.

## What is conflicted heritage?


## Suggestions
* The 7 Whys Technique: Ask 'why?' 7 times, starting with the question I consider to be at the core of my project.
* Using an artifact to tell a story: Explore the story of the MÃ¡ II as the subject of the capstone (instead of as secondary to the medium)
* Explore the use of an interactive documentary.
