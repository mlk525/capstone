# Production Assignment: Digital Art & Heritage

## Description
This week I decided to experiment with generative, algorithmic art. I was inspired by a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaarVR1AOvs) that popped up in my recommendeds exploring how Processing could be used to recreate "vintage" computer art. The video raised the question of whether some forms of electronic media has reached a point where they were now considered heritage (or at least museum-worthy). I think the answer is a yes.

I have found examples of obsolete electronic media being displayed in museums around the world, even discovering an [online museum](https://obsoletemedia.org/) exclusively dedicated to the documentation and preservation of obsolete media in audio, video, film, and data storage.

I chose to further explore the concept of recontextualizing artistic practices that were originally facilitated by media that is now outdated. This exploration then inspired the use of algorithmic art in recreating cultural practices that can be traced back to hundreds of years in the past. I began by trying to recreate simple zellij patterns. [Zellij](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zellij) is a style of hand-chiseled mosaic tilework, most notably used to create elaborate Islamic geometric motifs such as radiating star patterns (pictured below).
