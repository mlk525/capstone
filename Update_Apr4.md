# Progress Update (Apr 4)
Since my last blog post, I've been working hard to incorporate some new changes and improvements based on feedback from user testing and my own creative vision.

One of the biggest changes I've made is with the text that fades in as the viewer gets closer to the painting. I haven't incorporated it yet but I have a draft for the text that will appear:

“I am Teha'amana.”
“My name means “giver of strength”.”
“I am thirteen years old in this painting.”

“I am Teha'amana.”
“I was the “native wife” of Paul Gauguin during his first visit to Tahiti.”
“For this painting, he let me keep my clothes on.”

“I am Teha'amana.”
“French colonists often took children like me as native wives.”
“We were referred to as vahine, Tahitian for “woman”.”

“I am Teha'amana.”
“I was a muse to Paul Gauguin, but also his victim.”
“He painted me not as I was, but as he wanted me to be.”

I wanted to create a poem-like style while sticking to factual statements as much as possible to avoid saying things Teha'amana wouldn't reasonably think or say. Only the last stanza deviates from this, but I thought it was important to provoke engagement with ideas about the colonial and male gaze.

And while this prototype continues to use the AI generated images, on the advice of my mentor I've reached out to several Tahitian and French Polynesian artists over Instagram to see if they would like to contribute to my project. I hope to be able to replace the AI images with their work as soon as possible. This is important to me because I want to avoid any appropriation or commodification of the culture and art of French Polynesia.

I also edited the code so that once the painting completely fades into the AI art, the pictures rapidly change to give a trippy, glitchy impression. I'll probably change this once I (hopefully) get permission to use the artists' artwork, and once I incorporate the text.

Lastly, I edited Teha'amana out of the painting as one of the background images (the only one that's not AI generated), so it appears as if she's fading out of the painting. My mentor has recommended that I emphasize this effect, rather than switch between the AI generated images, as it helps to highlight the themes and ideas I'm trying to explore.
