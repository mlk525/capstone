# Test Materials for Budget
After meeting with Mang last week and finding out the new Capstone Showcase timeline (projects ready for display by the end of Spring Break), I made some major changes to my plans for my project. I scaled back heavily on the technological requirements, removed the physical computing components and decided to focus solely on making interactive paintings and/or carvings. I edited my project timeline and budget accordingly.

In the budget I tentatively included 3 projectors, 3 Raspberry Pi starter kits, and 3 webcams. Since the RPi starter kits are the costliest item on my budget, I wanted to make sure they would work as I hoped for the final project. While I don't have a Raspberry Pi of my own, I was able to borrow a RPi 4 Model B from a friend for this test.

Since he was already using the board the microSD card already had the OS installed, but I have flashed Raspbian (the RPi OS) onto microSD cards before so I don't think I'll have trouble with this step. After connecting the Pi to a TV screen as well as a keyboard and (wireless) mouse, I began to check if the board would be suitable for my use.

The mouse was pretty difficult to use, but I'm assuming that's because it was wireless and the board wasn't able to process the signals fast enough? The keyboard worked fine, so I'm hoping using a wired mouse will solve this problem. Next, I ran a couple of p5.js sketches on the onboard Chromium browser; they worked well. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to test out my Mona Lisa prototype because I couldn't find a suitable webcam to use. After some research I found that the latest RPi camera module would be more than enough for my needs. I intend to test out the motion tracking with regular webcams before placing an order for the modules, but I preemptively changed the webcams to the RPi modules in my budget.

I also tested the Pi out with a projector display; I quickly realized that 1. the projector would need to be extremely short-throw in order for people to be able to come close enough to interact with the paintings without casting a shadow and 2. the paintings looked far less realistic when projected compared to being displayed on an HDTV. For now, I've left the 3 projectors in my budget, but they will definitely be switched out soon. I need to ask if the school has any short-throw projectors available (since buying even one would be far too expensive for the budget), and failing that, if they have TV screens that can be oriented vertically. I have previously used TV screens to exhibit projects at IM showcases, so I know they're available, but I'll need to ask about mounting them vertically.

While playing around with different sketches and imagining what the paintings would look like mounted on a wall, I realized a wooden frame might be a good addition to deepen the immersion of the display being an actual painting. I've never made something like that before, but I do think it would need to be custom-made in order to fit around a TV screen. I'll be meeting with Jon Bonner to discuss the technicalities of this kind of project this week before I make a final decision.
