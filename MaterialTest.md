# Test Materials for Budget
After meeting with Mang last week and finding out the new Capstone Showcase timeline (projects ready for display by the end of Spring Break), I made some major changes to my plans for my project. I scaled back heavily on the technological requirements, removed the physical computing components and decided to focus solely on making interactive paintings and/or carvings. I edited my project timeline and budget accordingly.

In the budget I tentatively included 3 projectors, 3 Raspberry Pi starter kits, and 3 RPi camera modules. Since the RPi starter kits are the costliest item on my budget, I wanted to make sure they would work as I hoped for the final project. While I don't have a Raspberry Pi of my own, I was able to borrow a RPi 4 Model B from a friend for this test.

Since he was already using the board the microSD card already had the OS installed, but I have flashed Raspbian (the RPi OS) onto microSD cards before so I don't think I'll have trouble with this step. After connecting the Pi to a TV screen as well as a keyboard and (wireless) mouse, I began to check if the board would be suitable for my use.
