# Reflection on capstone progress so far
I began my capstone project research with the goal of choosing a subject to feature in my idea of a "better" museum. My search for a subject proved quite difficult, and I jumped from concept to concept, dissatisfied with my choices of subject and my ideas for how to make a more interactive, "better" museum.
While my capstone progress was greatly hindered by my constant second-guessing, the amount of research I did, especially through the lens of critical theory, really helped me to ground my capstone in broad themes that I wanted to address.
