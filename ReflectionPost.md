# Reflection on capstone progress so far
I began my capstone project research with the goal of choosing a subject to feature in my idea of a "better" museum. My search for a subject proved quite difficult, and I jumped from concept to concept, dissatisfied with my choices of subject and my ideas for how to make a more interactive, "better" museum.

While my capstone progress was greatly hindered by my constant second-guessing, the amount of research I did, especially through the lens of critical theory, really helped me to ground my capstone in broad themes that I wanted to address.  My motivation for wanting to propose an alternative to existing museum standards draws from post-colonialism, anti-imperialism, and deconstructing the hierarchy created by the practice "gazing". After drawing the conclusion that museums are essentially sites that facilitate and influence the gaze, I considered how their exhibits play a significant role in public perception of histories and cultures. The reception of an Other, whether past or present, is not passive or solely drawn from scholarly work, but is an active contributor to the creation of knowledge about this "Other". The development of ideas about cultures exhibited in museums are not the products of academic study alone, but of the way they are represented outside academic discourse too (such as in public museums).

I knew what I wanted to change about museums; in brief, I wanted to draw attention to how counterproductive most museums' forms are to the communication of their content (which is rarely perfect either). I wanted to make choices that would result in as faithful a representation as possible, and by introducing an interactive element, reduce and blur the separation between the observer and the observed. What I struggled with now was deciding what that interactive element looked like, and again, who the subject of the exhibition should be. I considered inventing a culure, using existing fictional cultures, and even ambitiously attempting to encapsulate my experience as an immigrant in the Gulf in the form of an educational museum exhibit.

After several discussions with my mentor about what my subject should be, I realized I was being held back by a fear of my exhibit not doing justice to the subject culture, or worse, being off-base or even offensive to lived experiences. I was being too ambitious with the project (as my capstone professor says, I have big ideas that I need to narrow down), and I decided to scale back to just thinking about the form. What is my ideal form of a modern museum? My mind immediately went to the movie "Night at the Museum" (where the exhibits in a museum come to life every night, in case you haven't seen it). I wanted historical museum subjects to come to life so we could stop thinking of them as objects or distant concepts, but real living beings with rich culture and heritage that we can barely begin to scratch the surface of. Children's museums often have the right idea with this. An interactive component is basically a necessity to communicate information. Dinosaurs, space, plants and animals are all very engaging museum subjects for children
