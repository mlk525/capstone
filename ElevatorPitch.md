# Elevator Pitch
My Capstone project (the Anti-Museum) deconstructs the hierachies of modern museums by reversing the roles of the observed and observer; it creates a space where the artifacts view you. By taking the simple premise of museum objects coming to life, the exhibition invites users (not viewers) to directly engage with ancient Egypt. Composed of 3 interactive installations, my Capstone seeks to reclaim and recontextualize heritage by challenging what users know about ancient Egypt, and what they know about museums.
