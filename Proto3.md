# Prototype 3: seven hours.

## Description
Exploring the idea of recontextualizing traditions and heritage further, I decided to create my own interactive art piece based on the principles of the Tibetan Buddhist tradition of sand mandalas. Sand mandalas are meticulously crafted, traditionally taking several weeks to build due to the large amount of work involved in laying down the sand in such intricate detail. A sand mandala is ritualistically dismantled once it has been completed and its accompanying ceremonies and viewing are finished to symbolize the Buddhist doctrinal belief in the transitory nature of material life.

I decided to create a textile piece designed to be destroyed over the course of its display as an interactive art work that reflected on impermanence and the idea of making peace with your hard work being intentionally destroyed.

I crocheted a swatch of yarn, about 25x31cm, and left the last stitch loose. While crocheting the piece, I drafted a piece of paper that would go behind the fabric, designed to be slowly revealed as the fabric was pulled undone. I titled the piece "seven hours" because of the total amount of time it took me to finish it (and consequently the final message on the paper). I pinned up the crochet piece (in front of the paper with the printed messages) firstly in front of the entrance to our dorm, inviting people to pull the loose yarn with a little sign.

The piece came undone over the course of two days, initially helped along by me. There was something intense about the messages behind the fabric that resonated with my friends, and some of them even lifted the piece to look at the remaining messages without pulling on the yarn. The experience of pulling on the yarn and un-knotting stitches felt very tactile (for lack of a better word), and sometimes people would undo more than one row of stitches at a time.

This was a very interesting experience for me, and I think it was the closest I've come to a "traditional" interactive art piece. I've left up what remains of the piece, and the pile of yarn sitting below the completely revealed paper continues to greet visitors to our dorm. I'm not sure if this brought me closer or took me farther away from finalizing on ideas for my capstone project, but it was quite an interesting exercise. If I were to implement it as one of the exhibition pieces for my capstone, I would do a circular piece instead, one that more closely resembles a traditional mandala, that takes far longer than seven hours to complete. I would also love to find a parallel for sharing the crocheted mandala with the world, as is Buddhist tradition (by pouring the sand mandala into running water).
