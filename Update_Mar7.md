# Progress Update - Midterm Exhibition (Mar 7)
This week I showcased my latest prototype at a community exhibition, and it was an important learning opportunity. The prototype was the same version I had used while [user testing](https://github.com/mlk525/capstone/blob/main/Update_Feb28.md), so while I hadn't had a chance to implement the suggested changes, I already had a good number of changes I was planning. My goal was to create an eerie and immersive experience that would leave a lasting impression regarding the voyeurism of the traditional museum experience, something I made sure to mention before asking for feedback from the professors and my classmates.

During the exhibition, I had the chance to get some amazing feedback. Many people were fascinated by the glitch, the text, and the eye-following effect, which made the painting feel like it was alive. Some people were even a little freaked out, which was exactly the reaction I was going for.

One of the most interesting things I learned was that people were really drawn to the text messages from the painting. They thought it was a clever way to add a new layer of depth to the experience and make it feel more interactive. A lot of people did say that the font was a bit jarring and hard-to-read, but since I hadn't put a lot of thought into the font choice, I wasn't worried about finding a more appropriate font style.

Of course, not all the feedback was positive. Some people felt like the eye-following effect could be improved to make it feel more natural, and others thought the glitch effect was a little too jarring in general. But overall, I was really happy with the response and the fact that so many people connected with the project.

Now that the exhibition is over, I'm already thinking about how I can improve the project for the future. One of the things I want to do is incorporate multiple paintings into the installation, so that viewers can experience different glitched paintings and get a sense of the range of possibilities. I also want to refine the eye-following effect and make it feel more organic, so that it's even more immersive.

Overall, I feel really grateful for the chance to share my project with the IM community and get feedback from professors and students I hadn't heard from.
