# Question about the Art World/Life after school
I'm curious what the most common career choice is for IM graduates with interests in installation art and digital media projects; what does the average work history of an IM grad look like, and what are the kinds of long-term career paths that are available to similarly skilled graduates?
I'm also curious whether graduate school (specifically a Master's) would be a good move for someone intending to continue creative interactive art, and if so, what are the typical fields that artists get a Master's degree in?
More specific to my current career hopes, what are ways for IM graduates to get involved with Galleries, Libraries, Archives, and Museums?
